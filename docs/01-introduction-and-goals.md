# Introduction and goals

This section covers the high level requirements for the Paperboy solution, and the most important quality goals.

## High level requirements

- Automatically assess the quality and interestingness of papers that I've found or received from others.
- Automatically generate a nice description for interesting papers so I can more easily publish links to papers.
- Track papers I've seen or received with associated metadata so I know what I have found previously.
- Provide an interface for others to search through interesting papers and ask questions.

## Quality goals

- The application must be easy to deploy to an environment like Azure through the CI pipeline.
- The content processing pipeline must be robust, I don't have time to go bug hunting.
- The application must be accessible for a broad public.
